"""
Alice found a magical deck of cards numbered from 2 to 1,00,000. Alice will pick up a card and she has to tell the number of ways she can make that number printed on card by using their prime factors else she will die. She doesnâ€™t know how to find this. Being Alice's friend you have to help her in finding out number of permutations.

Input Format

First line of the input consists of an integer T (no. of testcases).
Each testcase contains a single integer N.

Constraints

    1 <= T <= 100000
    1 < N <= 100000

Output Format

Print a single integer (number of ways she can make a number by their prime factors) for each testcase.

Sample Input 0

    3
    12
    6
    29

Sample Output 0

    3
    2
    1

Explanation 0

For first testcase, N=12; prime factors=2,2,3
No of ways:
1. 2*2*3
2. 2*3*2
3. 3*2*2
Hence, 3 ways are possible
